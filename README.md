Dear All-Band Receiver Enthusiasts,
-----------------------------------

First and foremost, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for the overwhelming response to my recent article on the all-band receiver. Your interest and enthusiasm have truly exceeded my expectations. When I published the article, I had no idea it would garner such a high turnout of comments and support.

Unfortunately, I wasm't exciting such a turnout, as I only had a couple of spare PCBs on hand. However, I have some great news! I’ll be producing more boards, which will incorporate the future enhancements described in [the article](https://idoroseman.com/how-to-use-an-all-band-receiver-to-listen-to-airplane-pilot-communications-with-ground-controllers/) and will be available for purchase online in a few weeks. 
You’ll have the option to buy the PCB on its own or as part of a kit that includes a 3D-printed enclosure.

For those who prefer a DIY approach, I’ve uploaded all the necessary files to a GitHub repository, so you can get started on your own build. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/idoroseman/all-band-receiver).

I also want to take a moment to thank the [original authors](https://techlib.com/electronics/allband.htm) who made this project possible: Charles Wenzel and Paul Beaumont (G7VAK). Their foundational work was instrumental in inspiring this project.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or ideas, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to hear your feedback and thoughts. You can email me at ido.roseman@gmail.com.

Thank you once again for your incredible support. Stay tuned for updates on the boards’ availability and other exciting developments!

Best regards,
Ido Roseman
